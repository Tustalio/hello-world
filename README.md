# hello-world
This is my tutorial repository

To anybody who may be reading this at any point in time, Hello! I'm learning how Github works. Been meaning to do this for a while... I intend to use this for many different projects that don't need to be kept private. The private ones, I assume, can still be put up here (I saw a way to change it to private), but I'm not sure how many since there was a "plan option" for unlimited private repositories. -(08/07/2017)
